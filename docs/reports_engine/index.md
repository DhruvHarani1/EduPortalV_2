The engine powers the Executive Dashboard and generates predictive analytics based on student academic performance and attendance records.

## Documentation Modules

1. [Dashboard Global Metrics](./01_dashboard_metrics.md) - System pulse, critical alerts, and global averages.
2. [Student Performance & Velocity](./02_student_performance.md) - Growth velocity curves, consistency matrices, and danger zones.
3. [Attendance & Fatigue Analytics](./03_attendance_analytics.md) - Weekly fatigue indexes and truancy prediction.
4. [Faculty Archetypes](./04_faculty_insights.md) - Equity scoring and pedagogical archetype classification.
5. [Future Sight / Career Simulation](./05_future_predictions.md) - Package projections, tier probabilities, and skill gap detection.
6. [Timetable Generation Engine](./06_timetable_generation.md) - Stochastic matrix scheduling, greedy placement, and daily constraint limits.
